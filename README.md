# Earthquake Pattern and Anomaly Detection

This project analyzes seismic activity data from South Asia to uncover patterns in earthquake magnitudes and frequencies. The goal is to visualize distribution trends, detect anomalies, and explore temporal or spatial clusters that may indicate significant geophysical events.

### Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Earthquakes South Asia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahnawaj9/earthquakes-south-asia)

---

### Project Structure

1. **Data Loading & Preparation** – Importing and cleaning seismic data (e.g., timestamps, magnitudes, and depths).
2. **Visual Exploration** – Histograms and time-series plots of earthquake magnitudes and occurrences.
3. **Anomaly Detection** – Identify spikes in earthquake counts or unusual magnitude trends over time.
4. **Temporal Pattern Analysis** – Monthly/yearly aggregation to highlight long-term shifts in seismic activity.
5. **Geospatial Mapping** *(optional)* – Visualize earthquake hotspots using geographic coordinates.

### Dependencies

- Python 
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

### Key Insights

- **Magnitude Distribution:** Most earthquakes are low to moderate in strength, with a few extreme events.
- **Temporal Trends:** Notable spikes in activity in certain years, possibly indicating tectonic shifts.
- **Potential Anomalies:** Sudden increases in magnitude or frequency within short periods detected.
